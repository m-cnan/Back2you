# üîé LISA ‚Äì Smarter Lost & Found System

**LISA** (Lost Item Search Agent) is a secure, private, and efficient lost-and-found web platform designed to solve a fundamental flaw in traditional systems: **public exposure**. Most platforms let everyone browse lost and found items ‚Äî making it easy for someone to falsely claim an item or misuse information.

LISA fixes that.

## üí° How It Works

- Users can report **lost** or **found** items.
- Each report includes:
  - Item details
  - Images (optional but improves matching)
  - Contact info (email, phone)
- **No one** can browse or search items.
- A **background matching system** intelligently compares lost and found reports.
- When a match occurs:
  - **Both users receive an email** with each other‚Äôs contact info.
  - They can then communicate and resolve the claim privately.

## üõ° Why It‚Äôs Better

- üîê **Private & Secure** ‚Äì No public listing, no fakes, no scams.
- üß† **Smart Matching** ‚Äì Uses fields like item type, location, and optionally image recognition.
- üì© **Notification System** ‚Äì Instant email alerts to both parties.
- üìç **Location Specific** ‚Äì Ideal for campuses, parks, stations, or any closed community.
